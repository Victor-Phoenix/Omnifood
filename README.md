# Omnifood Landing Page (HTML & CSS Course Project)

This is a responsive website built by following along with Jonas Schmedtmann’s HTML & CSS course on Udemy.

It was my first real HTML + CSS project — the first time I connected structure and style into a complete, responsive layout. I wrote every line by hand (no copy-pasting) to fully understand the logic behind each element and layout decision.

## What This Project Meant to Me

Before this course, I had only practiced small pieces of HTML and CSS without ever building something real. This was my first time putting everything together — structure, spacing, layout, and design — to make a professional-looking site.

Through this project, I finally felt like I understood how websites actually come together.

## What I Built

- Fully responsive desktop layout  
- Sections: header, hero, features, meals, testimonials, pricing, call to action  
- Built with semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid  
- Applied transitions, spacing systems, and clean design patterns

## What’s Not Finished

- Footer section is still missing  
- Mobile breakpoints and tablet responsiveness are not complete

I stopped here intentionally — my goal was to understand how HTML and CSS connect in a real project. That goal is complete, so I'm moving on to other areas of web development.

## What I Learned

- Semantic HTML5 and clean page structure  
- Responsive layout techniques with Flexbox and Grid  
- Spacing systems, color systems, and typography hierarchy  
- Building reusable UI components (buttons, cards, layouts)  
- Writing clean, organized CSS  
- Reading and troubleshooting layout issues using browser dev tools

## Course Credit

This project was built by following the HTML & CSS course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. All code was written manually by me — not copied — to understand each part.

## What’s Next

Now that I understand how to build a responsive layout with HTML and CSS, I'm moving on to backend and fullstack development to round out my skills and start building more original projects.
